### **Height vs Weight Regression**

**Purpose:**
This repository implements a simple linear regression model to predict a person's weight based on their height. The model is trained on a dataset containing height and weight measurements.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for training and evaluation is assumed to be located in the `/content/height-weight.csv` file. Please ensure that the dataset is in the correct format with columns for 'Height' and 'Weight'.

**Dependencies:**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
* **scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.

**Usage:**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/height-weight-regression.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   * Open the `SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
   * Execute the cells in order to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate performance.

**Model Architecture:**
The model is a simple linear regression model, which assumes a linear relationship between height and weight. The model is trained using the least squares method to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual weights.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of the MSE, which is often preferred for interpretation as it is in the same units as the target variable.
* **R-squared:** Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

**Future Work:**
* **Explore other regression models:** Consider trying other regression models like polynomial regression or support vector regression to see if they improve performance.
* **Feature engineering:** Experiment with creating new features or transforming existing ones to potentially improve model accuracy.
* **Hyperparameter tuning:** Tune the model's hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or regularization strength, to optimize performance.
* **Handle missing data:** If the dataset contains missing values, implement strategies to handle them appropriately.
